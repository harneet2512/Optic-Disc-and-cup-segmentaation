# Optic Disc Segmentation Project

## Overview

The optic disc (optic nerve head) is the location where ganglion cell axons exit the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic cup is the white, cup-like area in the center of the optic disc. The ratio of the size of the optic cup to the optic disc (cup-to-disc ratio, or C/D) is one measure used in the diagnosis of glaucoma.

## Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR)

The cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) is a crucial measurement used in ophthalmology and optometry to assess the progression of glaucoma. The CDR provides valuable information about the optic disc's structure and is a key indicator in diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma.

## Significance of Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation

The classification based on CDR is as follows:

- A C/D ratio less than 0.4 usually denotes a non-glaucomatous nerve unless the patient has an abnormally small optic disc size (which then requires further investigation).

- A C/D ratio between 0.4 and 0.8 can characterize a patient with a normal optic disc (i.e., physiologic cupping), a glaucoma suspect, or someone with early to moderate glaucoma (depending on the optic disc size).

- If the C/D ratio is 0.8 or greater, consider the individual's disc as glaucomatous unless proven otherwise.

## Project Goals

This project aims to develop an optic disc segmentation algorithm. Proper segmentation is vital for accurate measurement of the CDR, contributing to the early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma.
